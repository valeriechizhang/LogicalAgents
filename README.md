# LogicalAgents
A propositional logic resolution-based inference engine.


###Part 1: Two-Statement Resolution
A simple resolution function that resolves two sentences that are already in CNF.


###Part 2: Resolution Inference Engine
Accept CNF sentences and answer queries by following the resolution algorithm.


###Part 3: CNF Convertion
Convert logical expressions and convert them into CNF in addition to perform the resolution algorithm.


###How to run:
Run all tests: ./run_tests.sh tests
